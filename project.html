                    <p>This responsive, static website that you're currently enjoying was created using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery for design and content management, Bower as a package manager, and is hosted by GitHub Pages.

                    <p>GT Scribe was created with the intent to facilitate ease-of-use for a notetaking service provided to students with disabilities by the Office of Disability Services at Georgia Tech. The technology stack for the back-end was developed using Flask, Python, SQLite, and Amazon S3. The front-end was developed using HTML5, Jinja, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery.

                <div class="col-md-6 col-md-push-3"
                    <p>This information visualization was created to allow for an interactive display of data collected from the Washington Post about fatal police shootings that have occurred in the United States since January 2015, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings">here</a>. The visualization was created using HTML5, CSS3, D3, and Javascript. The visualization can be filtered by gender, race, age, and whether or not the police officer involved was wearing a body camera. The source code for this project can be accessed <a href="https://github.gatech.edu/ptadikonda3/Bananas_in_PJs">here</a> and the final project can be viewed <a href="police-shootings/index.html">here</a> with a video demo that can be watched <a href="https://youtu.be/JzFvMGvHyV4">here</a>.
